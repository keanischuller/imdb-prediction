Greetings!

This challenge aimed to predict the IMDB score of 12 upcoming movies using R techniques learned in our course. 

For the purpose of clarity and effective organization, we've intentionally divided our code submission into three separate files. 
This decision was made to ensure that the process of data exploration and understanding could be distinctly identified from the actual model building.

1. **Data Exploration 1** & **Data Exploration 2**:
    - These files correspond to Steps 1-3 and partially Step 4 from the project guidelines.
    - Together, they comprise more than 400 lines of code.
    - This extensive examination was crucial for us to deeply understand the dataset variables before embarking on the modeling journey.

2. **Prediction Model**:
    - This file is dedicated to the actual model construction and prediction tasks.
    - Within it, you'll find our rationale for choosing the specific modeling approach and the subsequent prediction results.

We hope this breakdown facilitates a smoother comprehension. We've endeavored to make our approach as transparent and structured as possible.


Warm regards,

K & Team
